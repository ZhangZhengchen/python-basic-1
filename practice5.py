def ASCII_codes(input_char):
    '''
    In this exercise, you will practice converting a character to its ASCII code in Python. 
    The ASCII code is a numerical representation of characters in the ASCII table. 
    Use the ord() function to convert the character to its ASCII code. The code has been given.
    
    You need to print the ASCII code.
    
    Remeber the ASCII code for 'A', 'a', and '0'. 
    Additionally, compare the ASCII codes of the following pairs of characters and remember which one is larger:
    'A' and 'B'
    'a' and 'b'
    '0' and '9'
    '0' and '1'
    '''
    # Convert character to ASCII code
    ascii_code = ord(input_char)
    # add your code here

# Note: When submitting your code, please comment out the line that runs the function 
# (e.g., ASCII_codes(input_char)) to avoid issues during automated testing.
input_char = 'a'
ASCII_codes(input_char)
