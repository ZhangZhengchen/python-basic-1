def salary_game():
    '''
    Write an input statement that requests the user to enter his salary. 
    Save the salary as an integer in a variable ‘salary’. 
    If the salary is smaller than 1000, increment the salary by 500 and print the new salary. 
    If the salary is bigger than 5000, decrease the salary by 600 and print the new salary. 
    If the salary in between 1000 and 5000 (inclusive), print the salary directly.
    Now if the new salary is 6000, directly print his salary. Otherwise, increment the salary by 20 and print the new new salary.
