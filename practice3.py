def variant_type(input_num):
    '''
    In this exercise, you will practice converting a number into different data types in Python 
    and printing the type of each converted value. 
    You will create a function that takes a single number as input 
    and converts it to an integer, a float, and a string. 
    Then, the function will print the type of each converted value.

    Below are the steps you will follow:

    Define a function that takes one parameter, 'input_num'.
    Convert 'input_num' to an integer and print its type.
    Convert 'input_num' to a float and print its type.
    Convert 'input_num' to a string and print its type.
    You can use the type() function in Python to get the type of a variable. For example: print(type(input_num))
    You can use a new variable to store the result of each conversion.
    '''
    # add your code here
    pass

# Note: When submitting your code, please comment out the line that runs the function 
# (e.g., variant_type(input_num)) to avoid issues during automated testing.
input_num = 10
variant_type(input_num)
