    Exercise: Practice Mathematical Operations in Python
    
    In this exercise, you will practice using various mathematical operations in Python. 
    Specifically, you will work with division, integer division, modulus, exponentiation, and multiplication.
    
    You are encouraged to try inputting different floating-point numbers 
    and integers to see how these operations behave. 
    
    Additionally, you will be implementing these operations in a function with two parameters, num1 and num2. 
    More details on functions will be discussed later.
    For this exercise, you do not need to consider the special case of division by zero.
    
    Below are the operations you will practice:
    Division (/)
    Integer Division (//)
    Modulus (%)
    Exponentiation (**)
    Multiplication (*)
    Parentheses (num1 + num2) * num2

    You must write the code in this exact order; otherwise, the automated test will not pass.
    
    Sample code:
    print(num1*num2)
    '''
    # add your code here
    pass

num1 = 2024
num2 = 10.0
